## Notes
  In this project I created a realtime search with analysis of most searched items. I separated user data by getting the visitors user agent so that users data are not mixed up.In this regard, the user is anonymous. I proposed way to sign in and sign up to associate users to the database(Not implemeted yet). In the backgroug , I implemented  active jobs to create and manage analytics .For realtime scalabillty, I propose redis with active jobs. Since heroku has ended free tier , I deployed to render.
